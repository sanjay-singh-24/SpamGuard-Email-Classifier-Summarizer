Project Overview
This project, SpamGuard: Smart Email Classifier & Summarizer, is a web application built using Streamlit, which is a Python library for creating interactive web apps. The purpose of this application is twofold:

Spam Detection: It checks whether an email is spam or valid.
Email Summarization: If the email is valid, it generates a concise summary of the email's content.
How It Works
User Input:

The user enters the body of an email into a text area on the web page.
Spam Detection:

The system uses a Logistic Regression model, a type of machine learning model, to check if the email is spam or not.
If the email is classified as spam, the app tells the user that no summary will be generated.
If the email is not spam (i.e., itâ€™s a valid email), it proceeds to the next step.
Email Summarization:

For valid emails, the app uses an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) model called BART from Hugging Face to generate a summary of the email.
The BART model is a state-of-the-art model for tasks like summarization, and it generates a concise, meaningful summary of the email content.
User Feedback:

The app shows whether the email is spam or valid and displays the summary of the email if it's valid.
Technical Details
Spam Detection Model:

The app is trained on a dataset called mail_data.csv that contains labeled email data (marked as spam or ham).
The emails are converted into numerical data using a technique called TF-IDF Vectorization, which transforms the text into features that the model can understand.
A Logistic Regression model is then trained to classify the emails as spam or valid.
Summarization:

For valid emails, the app sends the email text to an external API provided by Hugging Face. This API uses the BART model to generate a summary of the email.
Features
Spam Detection: The app detects whether an email is spam or valid using a machine learning model.
Summary Generation: If the email is valid, it generates a summary using the BART model from Hugging Face.
Interactive Interface: The user simply types or pastes the email into a text box and clicks a button to get results.
Steps to Use the Application
The user enters the body of an email into the provided text area.
They click the "Check Spam" button to start the spam check.
If the email is valid, the system will then generate a summary and display it.
Project Structure
Frontend: The user interacts with the app through a simple, easy-to-use interface built using Streamlit.
Backend: The machine learning model for spam classification is built using Scikit-learn and Logistic Regression.
Summarization: The email summarization is handled by the BART model provided by Hugging Face.
Dataset: A dataset (mail_data.csv) containing labeled email data is used to train the spam detection model.
Why This is Useful
Spam detection: Helps users identify and filter out unwanted or potentially harmful emails.
Email summarization: Saves time by providing a concise summary of valid emails, making it easier to understand the key points without reading the entire email.
Conclusion
This project combines machine learning and natural language processing to provide a powerful tool for classifying and summarizing emails. It's simple for users to interact with, and it makes use of advanced techniques like Logistic Regression for classification and the BART model for summarization. This application demonstrates how modern AI techniques can be applied to real-world tasks like email management.

Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on our conversation last week regarding the new marketing strategy for the upcoming quarter. We've made some great progress, and I wanted to share a few key updates with you:

Market Research: The research team has completed the initial market analysis. I’ve attached the full report for your review. We’ll need to refine our target demographics based on the data collected.
Creative Brief: The creative team has started drafting ideas for the new ad campaign. I'll be meeting with them on Wednesday to finalize the concepts and prepare for the upcoming presentation.
Timeline: We’re aiming to launch the first round of the campaign by mid-February. Please let me know if you have any concerns or would like to suggest any changes to the proposed timeline.
Could you provide an update on the progress of the customer segmentation task? I’d appreciate any feedback you might have before we proceed further.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best regards,
John Smith
